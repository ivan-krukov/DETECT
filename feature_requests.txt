Need a top predictions file
It has to show the top 5 repdictions over 0.2
    top 5 - have a list of predictions for any enzyme
    file - only write the top predictions if FILE is specified
	otherwise, write all to (just the original) to STDOUT
    maybe you should have an option "write top predictions to file", TRUE by default
	this will just add "_top_predictions" to the output file name
